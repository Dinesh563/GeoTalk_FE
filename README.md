## What is GeoTalk?

GeoTalk lets you share short messages with people nearby â€” no phone numbers, no emails, no accounts. Just location-based anonymous chat using geohashes.

## Why use it?

Imagine you're talking to a stranger and want to share:
- A job posting link
- A game room code
- Any short message

Instead of awkwardly exchanging contact info, just post it on GeoTalk. Anyone around you can see it instantly.

## How it works

- Uses your location to generate a **geohash**, representing a small area.
- Messages are only visible to people in the same and neighbouring geohash regions.
- No account or personal data required.

## Use Cases

- Share something with people in a cafe, park, or event.
- Ask for help or quick recommendations from locals.
- Broadcast alerts like a lost item or spontaneous meetup.
